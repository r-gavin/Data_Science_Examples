## Samples of Data Analysis

This directory contains a range of examples of data analysis. Some of 
the skills utilized here are
* getting and cleaning data
* exploratory data analysis
* machine learning
* statistical inference
* producing reproducible research

### Analysis of Personal Activity Data

Analysis of personal activity data to see if there are any discernable 
patterns in behaviors.

* reproducible research
* exploratory analysis
* imputing missing values

### Community Health, Economy, and Severe Weather

Investigate the relationship between severe weather events and the resulting 
effects to public health and local economies for a sample of communities or 
municipalities.

* reproducible research
* obtaining and cleaning data
* exploratory analysis

### Auto Transmissions and MPG

Aim to answer the following two items:
1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.  
Conduct *t-test* to answer those questions. Also perform a multivariate 
regression analysis. Link [here](https://github.com/r-gavin/insight_fellowship/blob/master/sample_data_analysis/RegModels.pdf).
* reproducible research
* exploratory analysis
* statistical inference
* regression analysis

### Statistical Inference and Tooth Growth study

Explore characteristics of the exponential distribution and how sample means 
and sample variance distributions of the exponential distribution conform to 
the Central Limit Theorem. Statistical study of the data collected during the 
The Statistics of Bioassay study. Link [here](https://github.com/r-gavin/insight_fellowship/blob/master/sample_data_analysis/stats_and_toothgrowth.pdf) 
or [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/r-gavin/insight_fellowship/blob/master/sample_data_analysis/stats_and_toothgrowth.html).
* reproducible research
* exploratory analysis
* statistical inference



### Classifying Quality of Barbell Lifts through Human Activity Recognition

Detailed analysis of the Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset. Document effort to 
create a predictive model to classify the quality of barbell lifts.
