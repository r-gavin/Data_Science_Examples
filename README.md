## Data_Science_Examples

This repository has been created to highlight a few side projects (for learning only) 
I have worked on to help develop some data science skills. A description of the 
contained directories follows below:

* **text_predict_app**: shiny app created to demonstate a text prediction model I built, 
contains relevent links and source files
* **other_data_apps**: contains a shiny app and two other interactive tools
* **sample_data_analysis**: various Rmarkdown summaries written on a few different topics, including techniques like
  - getting and cleaning data
  - exploratory data analysis
  - machine learning
  - statistical inference
  - producing reproducible research

Thanks for taking a look!
